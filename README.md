# TennielBot-Beta

Welcome to TennielBot, a discord bot made for the game Arcaea. Mostly made for private use, but you are welcomed to try.

**This is still in development and is missing a lot of features that I'm planning to add. Although, you can join the discord server to use/test the bot for yourself!*

***This bot is heavily inspired by LxBot, which is the biggest reason I made this bot.*

****I am very new to coding and make a lot of newbie mistakes, so I'm also treating this as a learning experiences, if anyone that is experienced notice any mistakes, feel free to notify me.*

# Best 30 Tracking

TennielBot can **manually** track your scores and automatically calculate your best 30 scores so you don't have to use Excel or pay for Arcaea Online.

## Generate B30 Images

Just like lxBot's '/a b30', TennielBot can generate graphical B30 with your scores.
*Again huge credits to LxBot and the LxBot's developer*

## Upload Your Scores

To track your score, all you need is the name of the song, difficulty and of course, your score. The bot will handle the rest. You can even see if a score has impacted your best 30 average instantly.

# Viewing Charts Info

Features song names autocomplete and embeds.
*also, have anyone notice that LxBot seems to stopped updating for new songs (since Abstruce Dilemma?)*


# Other Features

Random things I add just for fun.
