# TennielBot

Welcome to TennielBot, a discord bot made for the game Arcaea. Mostly made for private use, but you are welcomed to try.

*This is a running version of the bot, there is another version of this bot that is currently beeing worked on and then passed to this bot, you can check its repo in my account.*

*This bot is heavily inspired by LxBot, which is the biggest reason I made this bot.*

# Best 30 Tracking

TennielBot can **manually** track your scores and automatically calculate your best 30 scores so you don't have to use Excel or pay for Arcaea Online.

## Generate B30 Images

Just like lxBot's '/a b30', TennielBot can generate graphical B30 with your scores.
*Again huge credits to LxBot and the LxBot's developer for the inspiration.*

## Upload Your Scores

To track your score, all you need is the name of the song, difficulty and of course, your score. The bot will handle the rest. You can even see if a score has impacted your best 30 average instantly.
